Solutions of problems of "Computational Heat Transfer" course from Energy Engineering in Politecnico di Torino for the year 2023/24.
The term "Lacoste" is the nickname of the italian name of this exam ("Laboratorio COmputazionale di Scambio TErmico") and has nothing to do with... bags or polos. :)
The codes can change throughout the years, so it's better to pay attention if the resolution is still valid for those requests.
